This is my first web-development project that I try to use what I've learned from "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020" online course 
including
- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap
- Node. js
- Express
- MongoDB

This might not be the perfect website due to my lack of experiences and it's not fully finished yet. So, please understand if you still see anything doesn't work the way it should be I'll try to make it all work soon. 

Thank you for stopping by :)
